![Build Status](https://github.com/tillchen/Fyber-Challenge/workflows/build/badge.svg)

The Fyber Android challenge for the Mobile Developer role.

## Requirements

* [x] The user is able to show the list of offers configured with the data the user entered
   * **The app is retrieving the first page only now. We can improve this by adding paging or infinite scrolling.**
* [x] Each item on the list of offers contains the picture and the title of the offer
* [x] The application should check the data received has not been corrupted by checking the signature in the response
    * **Note that there's a `FIXME` in `MainActivity` regarding this.**
* At Fyber, we believe in testing and therefore we ask you to show us your skills in that matter. You must:
    * [x] Write Unit Tests: only a couple to show us you know what’s important to test and how to do so
    * [x] Write Functional Test: only a couple to show us you know what’s important to test and how to do so
